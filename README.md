# [WIP] BungeeLink
A simple plugin that allows easy communication between Spigot servers and BungeeCord proxy.

## Installation
* Copy universal (or platform based) jar to all servers including proxy
* Launch your servers to get config.yml files
* Open each config.yml file and set enabled to true.
  * If this config.yml is on proxy, copy the secret token and paste it to every config.yml file on servers.
  * If this config.yml is on server, copy the public token and put it in server map in config.yml file on proxy.
* Restart all servers and have a fun! (Reload is not recommended)
